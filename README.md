# Multivariate-Data-Analysis-Project
A framework on multivariate data analysis for finding meaningful information of Breast Cancer data and predicting the diagnosis using these measurements of pattern recognition.

We proposed two dimensionality reduction methods, which one is widely used and the other is inspired by multiple comparison method, and compared different classification approaches to predict the diagnosis of Breast Cancer. 

The data was used from the Univerity of California Irvine, the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.
